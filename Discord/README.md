1. Be sure to have [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Run FindMicNumber.ahk (if you have a lot of sources change the level of your mic in the sound settings to find it)
3. Right click MuteMic.ahk and replace the X by the number you just found <br>

### Bonus - 
If you want to run the script when windows start put a shortcut (or the script) here : <br>
%appdata&\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

The [source](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=15509) of the mute script.
