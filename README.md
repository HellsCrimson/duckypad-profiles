# Duckypad Profiles

Custom profiles for the [duckyPad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad).

## Usage

Rename each profile you want to use to change the `x` in `profilex` to be the profile number you'd like to use.

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/manual_setup.md) for copying profiles onto the duckyPad.

## Profiles

Use the help.txt if you want to use the mute key. Or replace the mute key by the mute of Discord (but Discord must be focused for the key to work)
